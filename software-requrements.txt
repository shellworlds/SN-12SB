Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Seamless Identity (The Foundation)

Set Up the Blockchain Backend: Choose an energy-efficient, scalable blockchain network (like an Ethereum Layer-2 or a consortium chain) to act as your foundational ledger.

Enterprise Identity Integration (SSO): Integrate standard enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems. By configuring your app as a Service Provider with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) or Okta, corporate users can log in using their existing work emails and passwords.

Embedded Wallets & Gasless Transactions: Connect the SSO login directly to an embedded wallet provider (like Sequence). This programmatically generates a secure wallet in the background for every user upon signup. Set up a relayer to handle "meta-transactions," meaning your system automatically pays the blockchain network fees (gas) so the user never has to touch cryptocurrency.

Phase 2: Building the B2B Enterprise SaaS App (The Frontend)

Secure Document Storage Interface: Build the user-facing Virtual Data Room where clinical researchers or supply chain managers can upload and view documents. The actual files should be stored securely off-chain (e.g., on encrypted cloud servers or IPFS), while only the cryptographic hash is sent to the blockchain.

Reputation-Based Approval Smart Contracts: Code the smart contracts for your "accept/reject" workflow. Program the logic so that users earn a dynamic reputation score based on their actions, and require a specific reputation-weighted threshold to be met before a document is officially approved on-chain.

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Integration: Implement ZKP cryptographic circuits (such as a zkEVM). This allows your enterprise clients to generate mathematical proofs of their compliance or document approvals without exposing their highly sensitive, proprietary data to the public ledger.

Phase 3: Building the AI Data Provenance API (The Developer Tool)

API Gateway & Security: Build a robust API-first pipeline specifically for AI developers. Implement strict security best practices, including short-lived authentication tokens, rate limiting, and automated drift detection to monitor API traffic.

Data Tracing Endpoints: Create specific API endpoints that AI companies can call before they train a model. When they send dataset metadata to your API, your system should automatically generate a cryptographic fingerprint (hash) of the data and anchor it to the blockchain.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Program your API to assign unique DIDs to every data source, model version, and AI agent. This ensures that every time the AI model is updated, the action is cryptographically attributed to a specific entity, creating an unbreakable chain of custody.

Phase 4: Audit Dashboards & Compliance Testing

The Auditor Portal: Build a simplified, read-only web dashboard designed specifically for external auditors, FDA inspectors, or legal officials. This portal will allow them to easily input a document or dataset and instantly verify its hash and timestamp against the blockchain ledger to prove its integrity.

Smart Contract Legal & Security Audits: Before launching, subject your smart contracts to rigorous third-party audits. Auditors must examine your code not just for technical vulnerabilities (like reentrancy attacks), but also to ensure the logic strictly complies with data privacy laws and financial regulations.
